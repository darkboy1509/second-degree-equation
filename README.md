# second-degree-equations-
This code is a simple Python program that can be used to solve second-degree equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. The user can enter the values for the coefficients a, b, and c in the GUI, then the program will calculate the solutions of the equation using the quadratic formula and display the solutions in message boxes.

The code makes use of the tkinter library, which is the standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It also uses the math library to perform square root calculations.

The program has three main functions:

solve_equation(): This function reads the values entered by the user in the GUI, then it calculates the solutions of the equation using the quadratic formula.
clear(): This function clear the input fields
reset(): This function set the input fields to 0
The program also has on_closing function that will be called when the user tries to close the window, it will display message box asking the user if they want to quit.

The code also includes a number of comments, which are lines of text that are ignored by the Python interpreter, but are included to provide explanations of what the code is doing
